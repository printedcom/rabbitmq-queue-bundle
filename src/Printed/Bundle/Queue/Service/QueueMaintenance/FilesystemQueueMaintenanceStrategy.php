/**
 * Class FilesystemQueueMaintenanceStrategy
 *
 * Queue maintenance strategy, that uses a lock file on the filesystem to track whether the maintenance
 * mode is on or off.
 *
 * Though simple, this strategy will silently not work in the case, when the maintenance mode is being
 * enabled in a _different_ project directory, than the current workers are running from. This happens
 * when deploying a new version of a project and trying to bring the maintenance mode up from the newly
 * deployed directory instead of the previous one. Since this is such a common case, I personally strongly
 * discourage anyone from using this strategy. But as one wise man once said: "An opinion is like
 * an ass. Everyone has their own."
