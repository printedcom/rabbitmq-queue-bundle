/**
 * Class CacheQueueMaintenanceStrategy
 *
 * Queue maintenance strategy, that uses a cache key to track whether the maintenance mode is on or off.
 *
 * This strategy doesn't suffer from the issue mentioned in FilesystemQueueMaintenanceStrategy, but
 * requires a cache solution.
 *
 * Caveat 1: if many of your project's environments (e.g. test environments) share one cache solution
 * (i.e. the same cache server), then it's your job to handle cache keys clashes from these environments.
 * I personally recommend using Doctrine's cache drivers, because they offer cache keys' namespacing
 * out-of-the-box. To set a cache namespace, copy&paste&alter the following:
 *
 *   rabbitmq_queue_bundle_cache:
 *     class: Doctrine\Common\Cache\MemcachedCache
 *     calls:
 *       - [ setMemcached, ['@memcached_instance'] ]
 *       - [ setNamespace, ['my_project_%kernel.environment%'] ]
 *
 * When done, provide this service's name via this bundle's configuration. WARNING: if you normally
 * namespace your cache with deployments' build times (or any other value, that uniquely identify
 * your project's deployments), then you must NOT use the same technique in the cache driver for this
 * bundle, because you'd run into the same problem FilesystemQueueMaintenanceStrategy suffers from.
 * E.g. the following namespace is wrong and will silently fail:
 * 'my_project_%kernel.environment%_%deployment.build_timestamp%'
 *
 * It's best to namespace the cache driver with the vhost of the deployment (the same idea as Rabbitmq's
 * vhosts).
 *
 * The only reason why this strategy requires an instance of Doctrine\Common\Cache\Cache and not
 * Psr\Cache\CacheItemPoolInterface is because doctrine's cache doesn't implement the psr interface.
 * This would make my recommended way for solving caveat 1 not work.
